Consider the function 
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
If we calculate $f^{(n)}(0)$, we seem to get $n!$
(see sec.~\ref{sec:factorial}, p.~\pageref{sec:factorial} for the notation
and the special case $0!=1$).\index{factorial}

Proof by induction was introduced in section \ref{subsec:natural-powers}, p.~\pageref{induction}.
Use induction to prove that $f^{(n)}(0)=n!$.
